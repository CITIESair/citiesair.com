                "mainText": "Air pollution is among the 4th leading factors for premature death, claiming over 6 million lives worldwide in 2019 [1]. Microscopic particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) can penetrate and lodge into the lungs and internal organs, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [2, 3]. Several countries worldwide experience prolonged periods of PM2.5 concentrations for different reasons. The UAE, in particular, is susceptible to periods of high PM2.5 concentrations due to its exposed desert geographical topography, anthropogenic emissions, and industrial activities.<br/><br/><b>CITIESair</b> is an integrated system of air quality devices and specialized software designed for schools and institutions in Abu Dhabi. Started with educational institutions, we aim to expand to others such as residential communities and offices. CITIESair’s mission is to empower data-driven decision-making and the design of informed policies to safeguard communities from air pollution. This project responds to CITIES’ strategic objective of promoting sustainable living, improving the overall well-being of Abu Dhabi citizens, and contributing to the UAE’s efforts to reduce air pollution's mortality rate from 64.8 in 2017 to 60.2 per 100,000 people by 2030 - <a href='https://gggi.org/uae-national-air-quality-strategy-2021-2031-stakeholders-workshop/'>UAE National Air Quality Strategy (2021-2031)</a>.<br/><br/><b>CITIESair</b> achieves this by equipping each participating institution a set of commercial-grade indoor and outdoor air quality sensors, enabling real-time comparisons and encouraging the expansion of indoor sensor coverage for comprehensive indoor air quality monitoring. Complementing these sensors are historical dashboards that provide detailed analytics and visualizations of hourly, daily, and monthly trends. Together, CITIESair’ tools empower schools and institutions to make data-driven decisions that safeguard their communities from the impacts of outdoor air pollution, students, educators, and employees alike.<br/><br/> Since Fall 2023, <b>CITIESair</b> has forged a strategic partnership with <a href='https://www.iqair.com/'>IQAir</a>, a global leader in air quality. This collaboration allows CITIESair to <a href='https://www.iqair.com/profile/6ra7i359e'>share</a> outdoor air quality data on the world's leading website to benefit local communities. Additionally, it offers expert industry support and provides cutting-edge air quality sensors and purifiers for indoor air purification initiatives.",
