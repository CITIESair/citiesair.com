Microscopic particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) can penetrate and lodge into the lungs and internal organs, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases [2, 3]. Several countries worldwide experience prolonged periods of PM2.5 concentrations for different reasons. The UAE, in particular, is susceptible to periods of high PM2.5 concentrations due to its exposed desert geographical topography, anthropogenic emissions, and industrial activities.<br/><br/><b>CITIESair</b> is an integrated system of air quality devices and specialized software designed for educational institutions in Abu Dhabi. CITIESair's mission is to empower data-driven decision-making and the design of informed policies to safeguard school communities from outdoor air pollution. This project responds to CITIES' strategic objective of promoting sustainable living, improving the overall well-being of Abu Dhabi citizens, and contributing to the UAE’s efforts to reduce air pollution’s mortality rate from 64.8 in 2017 to 60.2 per 100,000 people by 2030 - <a href='https://gggi.org/uae-national-air-quality-strategy-2021-2031-stakeholders-workshop/'>UAE National Air Quality Strategy (2021-2031)</a>.<br/><br/><b>CITIESair</b> achieves this by equipping schools with data-driven tools to safeguard students, educators, and staff from outdoor air pollution, such as the historical dashboard, offering detailed data analytics and visualizations for hourly, daily, and monthly trends. Each school receives a set of commercial indoor and outdoor air quality sensors, enabling real-time outdoor vs. indoor comparison and encouraging the expansion of indoor sensor coverage for comprehensive indoor air quality monitoring on campuses.<br/><br/> In Fall 2023, <b>CITIESair</b> forged a strategic partnership with <a href='https://www.iqair.com/'>IQAir</a>, a global leader in air quality. This collaboration allows CITIESair to <a href='https://www.iqair.com/profile/6ra7i359e'>share</a> outdoor air quality data on the world's leading website to benefit local communities. Additionally, it offers expert industry support and provides cutting-edge air quality sensors and purifiers for school air quality initiatives.",
